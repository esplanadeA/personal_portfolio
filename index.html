As a result, after taking a career break to visit family I haven't seen for four years, I am now actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and experience in this new field. I am excited to bring my creativity, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities to a new role as a web developer and eager to learn and grow in this rapidly-evolving industry. I am confident that my transferable skills and strong work ethic, which I honed during my previous career, will serve me well as I embark on this exciting new journey.
